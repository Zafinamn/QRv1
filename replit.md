# Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a minimal project repository containing only a basic README file. The project appears to be in its initial stages with the identifier "QRv1", suggesting it may be intended as a QR code-related application or service. The current state provides no implementation details, dependencies, or architectural decisions to analyze.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

Based on the current repository state, no architectural decisions have been implemented yet. The project structure suggests this is a greenfield project awaiting initial development. Key architectural considerations for future development may include:

- **Application Framework**: Choice of frontend and/or backend framework will need to be determined
- **Data Storage**: Database selection and schema design requirements are undefined
- **Deployment Strategy**: Hosting and deployment approach has not been established
- **Authentication**: User management and security implementation is pending

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies, services, or integrations are currently defined in the repository. The project lacks:

- Package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Configuration files for external services
- Database connection specifications
- Third-party API integrations
- Cloud service configurations

Future development will require establishing these dependencies based on the chosen technology stack and feature requirements.
